Move these files without the folders into the dominion/images folder. You can leave out the images in the blanks folder.


I created these in several hours using the version of MSPaint bundled in Windows 7.


I have no plans to add graphics to these images as I am not an artist.



Here are the fonts I used in creating the text for the images:

Title Text
Monotype Corsiva 18pt Italic

VP Numeral
Book Antiqua 48pt Italic Black over 48pt Bold Italic White

Coin Numeral
Book Antiqua 72pt Black over 72pt Bold White

Rules Text
Segoe UI Light 8pt

Treasure Coin Value
Segoe UI Light 8pt Bold

Cost Numeral
Impact 10pt
